# MECH-535
This Matlab program computes the blade shape shape in a turbine for the given initial conditions.

1. Run comp.m, incomp.m, analytical.m
2. Run BladePlot3D and PropPlot2D

The plotting programs require the data generated by the computing programs. The results of the computing programs are put into text files, which are then read by the plotting programs.
